    <h2>Gifts of Hope</h2>
    <p>In partnership with Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in Syracuse, NY, our Gifts of Hope campaign is an annual Christmas initiative that provides $100 gift cards to the families of children who are currently undergoing treatment for cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. Our hope and prayer is that these gift cards are able to provide families with hope and a bit of joy this holiday season, which they can use in any way necessary.</p>

    <h2>Mom Boxes</h2>
    <p>Our Mom Boxes consist of makeup items, skin care products, a devotional, and a food gift card. The purpose of these boxes is to provide moms in particular with products that will help them feel more like themselves as they take care of their children.</p>

    <h2>Financial Assistance</h2>
    <p>The treatment plan for a child often demands constant travel and extended hospitals stays. Parents often go weeks and months without working - some even losing their jobs - in order to care for their child. We provide financial support to approved families for travel and food expenses as well as unexpected or miscellaneous bills.</p>

    <h2>Bereavement Assistance</h2>
    <p>Knowing that nothing can prepare you for the sudden and heartbreaking loss of a child, the last thing that people should have to think about is if they can even afford funeral and interment expenses. Because of this, we help cover bereavement expenses to lighten some of the financial burden for families who have recently lost a child.</p>
