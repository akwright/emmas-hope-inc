    <h2>Gifts of Hope</h2>
    <p>In partnership with Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in Syracuse, NY, our Gifts of Hope campaign is an annual Christmas initiative that provides $100 gift cards to the families of children who are currently undergoing treatment for cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. Our hope and prayer is that these gift cards are able to provide families with hope and a bit of joy this holiday season, which they can use in any way necessary.</p>

    <h2>Mom Boxes</h2>
    <p>Our Mom Boxes consist of makeup items, skin care products, a devotional, and a food gift card. The purpose of these boxes is to provide moms in particular with products that will help them feel more like themselves as they take care of their children.</p>

    <h2>Essentials Basket</h2>
    <p>The Essentials Basket will consist of items most commonly forgotten by parents (garnered from our past experience) as well as items to help make admissions in the hospital more comfortable and pleasant.</p>
    <p>Each basket will include a food gift card, a parking garage voucher, healthy pre-packaged snacks, and toiletry items.</p>

    <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
    <p>We are currently working with the staff at Upstate Golisano Hospital to finalize additional services and offerings that we can provide for families, both in and outside the hospital.  However, we need your financial help to make any of the services we provide a reality.</p>
