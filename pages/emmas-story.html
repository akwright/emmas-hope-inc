    <h1 class="site-title">Emma's Story</h1>
    <p>We were a happy little family. God had blessed us with a busy little girl who was extremely social even as a baby. However, it was important to us that this sweet social girl learned how to entertain herself and learn to use her imagination. One day, we walked into the living room to discover that she was practicing this   &#8220;self-play&#8221; we were encouraging...she was essentially playing fetch with herself. It was at that moment the Lord put on our hearts that she needed a playmate. A few short months later we found out God was going to give her a playmate. Initially, we had on our mind that we would be adding a brother to our little tribe so we began discussing boy baby names. Jane would like one name at night, wake up the next morning and hate it. Or Alex would like the full name of one but not like the nickname that would inevitably come with it. It was getting stressful at the thought of not having a name for this little baby. Now we are under the persuasion that it's fun to find out the gender prior to the birth and have a gender reveal party with the whole family. We were able to have the ultrasound tech not tell us at the appointment but rather she graciously called the bakery to tell them what color frosting to put into the middle of the cake we had pre-ordered. We had taken the extended families guesses the results were: Boy- 18?(find out the specific number) Girl- 3. When we cut into the cake....PINK!! We were going to have a girl!! We were thrilled! Especially because we hadn't even talked about girl names!! Within a day or two we effortlessly agreed on her name, Emma Grace.</p>

    <p>Bright and early the morning of March 27 we met our giant blue eyed girl, Emma Grace. Before we left the hospital the nurse brought Emma in and stated very matter of fact, &#8220;This baby has got a powerful set of lungs.&#8221; Two traits that she was immediately known for were her large blue eyes and her loud voice. She also could convey exactly what she was thinking without even needing to use words. Her eyebrows spoke volumes when her lungs weren't. Her big sister held her every chance she got. Months later, she helped feed Emma, sang and read to her...(add other things?) From the day she was born Emma did her own thing: cutting her first tooth the day she turned 4 months, didn't care to socialize with anyone other than her sister and parents for at least 8 months, walking by 10 months,(anything else?)</p>

    <p>After escaping the NY winter by being  &#8220;snow-birds&#8221; for 6 weeks at the start of 2016, we came back from Florida not knowing that that was the calm before the storm. Within the our first month back Addy broke her thumb and had eye surgery. For those that don't know, Jane is a stay at home mom and Alex works from home as a website guru...? :) As any parent will tell you, your kids seem to have good days and bad days. Well one seemingly random Thursday was one of the hard days for Jane. Everything seemed to be working against her, the girls decided it wasn't a good day to nap so very little on her to-do list got done. We were going to go on a date that night, it had been months since our previous date night because as mentioned before Emma didn't tolerate anyone other than her sister and parents for too long. Alex being the smart, kind husband he is, graciously suggested that Jane take a break to go spend time with God while he worked on the to-do list. It was a much needed  &#8220;time-out&#8221;. This is the devotional she read.</p>

    <figure class="quote">
      <blockquote>  &#8220;This is a time in your life when you must learn to let go: of loved ones, of possessions, of control. In order to let go of something that is precious to you, you need to rest in My Presence, where you are complete. Take time to bask in the Light of My Love. As you relax more and more, your grasping hand gradually opens up, releasing your prized possession into My care. You can feel secure, even in the midst of cataclysmic changes, through awareness of My continual Presence. The One who never leaves you is the same One who never changes: I am the same yesterday, today and forever. As you release more and more things into My care, remember that I never let go of your hand. Herein lies your security, which no one and no circumstance can take from you."</blockquote>

    <p>Jane felt the Lord's presence as He used that devotional and scripture to remind her that He is in control, especially when it comes to her children and she didn't feel in control. We went on our date, we saw a movie...couldn't tell you what one it was. insert picture of us on date I think it's on Alex's computer.</p>

    <p>The next morning we called to make an appointment for Emma with our pediatrician, she had been having a cough that came and went for about 2 weeks at this point. God was kind that we were able to get in within a few minutes. Visually, Emma looked completely healthy, walking around, laughing and smiling. When her doctor listened to her chest though, she had a concerned looked on her face as she listened to the left side. After moving the stethoscope several times and not being able to hear any air flow from the left lung, she sent us to a local clinic to have an x-ray taken of her lungs. The x-ray showed that her left lung was completely whited on, which we were told could be 1 of 2 things: 1. fluid from pneumonia or 2. in a &#8220;very rare and unlikely case&#8221; a tumor. Well, like most parents, we didn't even consider that it could be a tumor, and promptly put that out of our minds.</p>

    <p>We drove up to Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital to have further testing done to find out exactly what was going on in her lungs. She had more x-rays done and an ultrasound. You'll pick up very quickly, but God was kind to show us repeatedly that His hand was on her life no matter what happened. While we waited in a small room in the ER for several hours, Emma was her normal self. Walking around playing with the only toy-like object we could find...an unused vomit bag which she would throw and go get. Every person who came into the room after seeing her x-ray said the same thing   &#8220;if you showed me this little girl and then the x-ray I would assume you were talking about two different children. For how bad her x-ray looks, she should not be walking around and looking so happy.&#8221; Based on the tests it was determined that Emma had fluid in her lungs from pneumonia which was strange but she would need to have a tube put in to drain it out. She had the surgery the following day and over the next two weeks 900cc's...use oz or liters. All the while maintaining her normal happy self, walking around the room (as much as she could be tethered with the tube), waving at the door to whoever was walking by. we remained in the hospital for a total of 12 days. Then we got to go home but were told to come back if anything seemed suspicious. We were home for one week before we noticed her breathing was more labored. At first it was assumed the fluid from pneumonia had returned. After another round of tests and a second ultrasound, a discrepancy was found between the two ultrasounds. She had a biopsy done the next day. We were told it might take a few days to a week before they had a definitive answer as to what a possible diagnosis could be. Well we found out when did we find out...that same day? The next day? It was very quick. Emma was diagnosed with stage 3 of a rare form of lung cancer called PleuralPulmonary Blastoma (PPB). We were told only 40 people a year nation wide are diagnosed with PPB. Out of those diagnosed, a majority are stage 1, with even fewer being diagnosed with stage 3.</p>

    <p>I will never forget the look on the oncologists face as she told us the news, fully and rightfully so expecting us to completely break down. But we didn't. I had such an overwhelming feeling of peace come over me. Mentally, I went into a fight mode, as in &#8220;she is going to defeat this&#8221;.</p>
